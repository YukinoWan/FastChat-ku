Literature: War and Peace is a novel by Leo Tolstoy, first published in 1869. The work is epic in scale and is regarded as one of the most important works of world literature. It is considered Tolstoy's finest literary achievement, along with Anna Karenina.\nThe novel chronicles the history of the French invasion of Russia and the impact of the Napoleonic era on Tsarist society, as seen through the eyes of five Russian aristocratic families.\nThe novel is generally regarded as a masterpiece of realist fiction and one of the best historical novels of all time.\n2. History: World War II was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, though related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nations\u2014including all of the great powers\u2014eventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis.\nIt was the most widespread war in history, with more than 100 million military personnel mobilized. In a state of \"total war\", the major participants placed their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities at the service of the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources.\nMarked by significant cooperation between the Soviet Union and the Western Allies, the Allies' victory was assured by the surrender of Germany and Japan within a few months of each other in 1945.\n3. Science: Water is a transparent fluid which forms the world's streams, lakes, oceans and rain, and is the major constituent of the fluids of organisms. As a chemical compound, a water molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms that are connected by covalent bonds.\nWater is a liquid at standard ambient temperature and pressure, but it often co-exists on Earth with its solid state, ice; and gaseous state, steam (water vapor). It also exists as snow, fog, dew and cloud.\n4. Art: Mona Lisa is a half-length portrait of a woman by the Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci, which has been described as \"the best known, the most visited, the most sung about, the most written about, the most parodied work of art in the world.\"\nThe painting, thought to be a portrait of Lisa Gherardini, the wife of Francesco del Giocondo, is in oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel, and is believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506.\nIt was acquired by King Francis I of France and is now the property of the French Republic, on permanent display at the Louvre Museum in Paris.\nThe painting is a typical Renaissance work and depicts Lisa, seated, wearing a vermeil silk dress, its sleeves lined in pearl-gray silk and its low neckline trimmed with lace.\nThe work is in excellent condition, with no sign of wear or tear. The original is surrounded by a security wall and protected by two armored doors.", "1. Literature: Leo Tolstoy was a Russian writer who primarily wrote novels and short stories. Later in life, he also wrote plays and essays.\nTolstoy is equally known for his complicated and paradoxical persona and for his extreme moralistic and ascetic views, which he adopted after a moral crisis and spiritual awakening in the 1870s, after which he also became noted as a moral thinker, social reformer, and Georgist.\nHis literal interpretation of the ethical teachings of Jesus, centering on the Sermon on the Mount, caused him in later life to become a fervent Christian anarchist and anarcho-pacifist.\nTolstoy's ideas on nonviolent resistance, expressed in such works as The Kingdom of God Is Within You, had a profound impact on such pivotal 20th-century figures as Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr.\nTolstoy is one of the world's most translated authors.\n2. History: Franklin Delano Roosevelt was an American statesman and political leader who served as the 32nd president of the United States from 1933 to 1945.\nA Democrat, he won a record four presidential elections and emerged as a central figure in world events during the mid-20th century.\nRoosevelt directed the United States government during most of the Great Depression and most of World War II, which ended shortly before his death.\nDuring the first 100 days of his presidency, he enacted the New Deal, which included the establishment of the Social Security system.\n3. Science: Water is a chemical compound with the chemical formula H2O. A water molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms that are connected by covalent bonds.\nWater is a liquid at standard ambient temperature and pressure, but it often co-exists on Earth with its solid state, ice; and gaseous state, steam (water vapor).\nIt also exists as snow, fog, dew and cloud.\n4. Art: Leonardo da Vinci was an Italian polymath, painter, sculptor, architect, musician, mathematician, engineer, inventor, anatomist, geologist, cartographer, botanist, and writer.\nHe is widely considered to be one of the greatest painters of all time and perhaps the most diversely talented person ever to have lived.\nHis genius, perhaps more than that of any other figure, epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal.\nDa Vinci has often been described as the archetype of the Renaissance Man, a man of \"unquenchable curiosity\" and \"feverishly inventive imagination\".\nHe is widely considered to be one of the greatest painters of all time and perhaps the most diversely talented person ever to have lived.\nHis genius, perhaps more than that of any other figure, epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal.\nDa Vinci has often been described as the archetype of the Renaissance Man, a man of \"unquenchable curiosity\" and \"feverishly inventive imagination\"."]}], "tstamp": 1688873238.3944678}
