We call this architecture ExeMA.\n* On language modeling, the perplexity difference between our model and a vanilla transformer is negligible, but that's because next-token prediction is almost always a local task, so perplexity won't be sensitive enough to detect any improvements in long-range understanding.\n* However, on the SCROLLS benchmark, our model improves by 10% over the baseline.\n* We also have a new metric for measuring coherence in generated text (CoGnaTe), where our model generates text that is 43% more coherent than the baseline.\nHelp me write the paper's introduction."]}
