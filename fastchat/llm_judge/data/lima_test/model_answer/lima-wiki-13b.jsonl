However, there are many cases where the transformer model has limitations.\nAs a result, many studies have attempted to improve the performance of transformer models. The main improvement direction is to enhance the attention mechanism. For example, in the encoder, the self-attention mechanism enables the model to learn the relationship between input tokens. The work of Vaswani et al. also introduced a multi-head attention mechanism, which is very flexible and has a better modeling capacity. In the decoder, the work of Shen et al. proposed a gated self-attention mechanism, which effectively learns the context and improves the performance of the model.\nHowever, all the above-mentioned improvements are mainly based on the attention mechanism within a single head. In this paper, we propose an exponential moving average (ExeMA) mechanism to replace some of the attention heads. We found that an ExeMA head can improve the understanding of long-range dependencies.\nIn the next section, we will also analyze the reasons for this improvement. In addition, we conducted experiments on natural language generation (NLG) tasks and found that our model can generate more coherent text."]}], "tstamp": 1688899160.499825}

Each player decides which of the three hand gestures to make: a fist (rock), a flat hand (paper), or a fist with the thumb sticking out (scissors). The player with the rock beats the player with the paper, the player with the paper beats the player with the scissors, and the player with the scissors beats the player with the rock.\nAn equilibrium is a strategy that each player can employ to guarantee a win, and if both players employ the same strategy, they will both win. For the rock paper scissors game, we can show that there are two pure strategies that guarantee a win.\nThe first strategy is to always play scissors. If the opponent plays paper, you win. If the opponent plays rock, they win. So you always win. The other strategy is to play paper. If the opponent plays rock, you win. If the opponent plays scissors, they win. So you always win.

His most famous poem, \"The Voice of the Balkan Mountains\", is a stirring ode to the heroic qualities of the people of the Balkans.\nBotev was born in 1848 in the village of Kalofer, Bulgaria. He was the son of Nikola Botev and Dora Krasteva, who were members of the Bulgarian Insurrection Movement. The family was a group of intellectuals and revolutionaries who advocated for the independence of Bulgaria from Ottoman rule.\nBotev studied in Romania from 1871 to 1874. He was a teacher and a journalist, and traveled extensively in Western Europe. He was a prominent member of the Bulgarian nationalist movement and a fervent advocate for the independence of Bulgaria from Ottoman rule.\nBotev was a political exile in Bucharest, Romania. He was arrested there in 1876 and condemned to death, but his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. He escaped from prison in 1878, along with 40 other political prisoners. He spent the following years in Western Europe, working as a journalist.\nThe leader of the Bulgarian nationalist movement, Stefan Stambolov, was assassinated in July 1886. Botev was accused of the murder, but he was able to prove his innocence. He returned to Bulgaria in 1887 and founded the Internal Revolutionary Organization.\nBotev organized a small group of revolutionaries and led them to the Stara Planina Mountains to fight the Ottoman army. He led a group of 60 men in an attack on a Turkish garrison in the town of Karlovo on November 10, 1877. The Bulgarian revolutionaries were defeated, and Botev was badly wounded. He was shot in the head and died on November 10, 1878.\nBotev is still regarded as a great Bulgarian poet and nationalist.

It is important to reassure the child and provide a safe environment that encourages exploration.\nHere are some tips to help your child cope with change and avoid separation anxiety:\n1. Make time for play: Children can become clingy when they are bored or feel neglected. Schedule regular activities that create opportunities for interaction, like playdates, outings, and games.\n2. Stay calm and confident: Avoid yelling or raising your voice, as children may feel scared or threatened. Maintain a calm and positive attitude when talking to the child, as they are more likely to trust and listen to you.\n3. Practice separation: Gradually help your child learn to cope with separation by starting with short periods of time and increasing the duration as he or she becomes more comfortable. Remind the child that you will be back soon and try to keep the goodbye brief.\n4. Give reassurance: Tell the child what you will be doing while you are apart, and explain how you will return. Also, give the child a toy or object that has a special meaning to remind him or her of you.\n5. Follow a routine: Children often find reassurance in a routine. Maintain similar bedtimes and mealtimes, and follow a regular schedule for activities like bath time and story time.\n6. Stay close by: Stay nearby when you drop your child off at school or daycare, or at the park when they are playing. Encourage them to play with other children and talk to their teachers or coaches.\n7. Talk about feelings: Talk openly with your child about his or her feelings, and encourage them to express themselves. Give opportunities to express their feelings, such as art sessions or play therapy.\n8. Be patient: Clingy behavior can be stressful. Take your time to identify the cause of the behavior, and be patient with the child."]}], "tstamp": 1688909540.6718073}

Portable air purifier: These are designed to be portable and can be used in a variety of spaces from an office to a home.\n3.

Do you see a lot of dust? Is the air stale? Do you experience frequent allergies? If so, an air purifier is a good idea.\nAir purifiers use different methods to clean the air in your home. Some use ionic technology to create negatively charged particles that attract positively charged particles. These particles stick together and get removed from the air. Other air purifiers use ultraviolet lights to kill airborne bacteria.\nAfter you decide on a purifier, find a place to install it. The ideal spot is one that's not too close to any HVAC vents, as those vents may push dust particles back into the air. If you have an existing HVAC system, consider having a clean air duct installed to help improve the quality of your home's air.\nAir purifiers can be a big help in a small home, but they may not be enough to completely remedy the situation.

For example, if someone does not eat meat, they may feel pressure to eat meat in a group of people who do eat meat.\nOther factors, like convenience and cost, can also influence the food choices that people make.

You can use the following guidelines to help you improve communication in your relationship:\n1. Be honest.\nGood communication in a relationship means being honest with your partner. You should be able to open up with your partner and share your thoughts and feelings. Don't avoid telling your partner something because you are afraid they will get upset.\n2. Don't assume.\nWhile you are being honest with your partner, you should also be open to hearing what they have to say. Don't assume you know what your partner is thinking or feeling.
